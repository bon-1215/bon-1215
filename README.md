Hi there! 👋 I'm *José Bolivar*, a passionate Frontend developer from Acapulco, Mexico. I love exploring new technologies, building innovative projects, and contributing to open-source communities. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me 🌟

I'm a ***Frontend developer*** with a strong background in React applications and web development. My journey into the world of technology began when I discovered that I had a great passion for coding solutions and especially web pages, however at that time I had no idea of the various and many tools that are used for web or application development. That's why I focus on studying and researching more about this field.

I thrive on challenges and enjoy learning something new every day. I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge-sharing to drive positive change in the tech world.
